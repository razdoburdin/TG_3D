##Compilation
To compile project run 'make' in terminal.

You need to have the following:
+ c++ compiler
+ make
+ gnu scientific library (gsl)
+ argtable

(Note that code was tested only for gcc in bouth Linux and Mac).

(If you have gcc<4.9, you need to set "VECTORIZE=no" in configs/link_keys.conf).

##Running the code
To start calculations run 'make task' in terminal.

##Configuration
###Non-numerical parameters (configs/link_keys.conf)
+ Choosing of the background flow:
BACKGROUND={homogeneous, polytropic, isothermal}
+ Choosing of the metric type (now only one type is available)
METRIC=3D
+ Choosing of the boundary conditions:
BOUNDARY={first, second, periodic}
Boundary conditions of first type mean that W=0 at the boundaries, second --- dW/dz=0
+ Using vectorisation in parallel regions of the code (gcc >=4.9 is required)
VECTORIZE={yes, no}
+ Using additional conditions of iterations interruption (see paragraph "Conditions of iterations interruption" for details):
SIGNAL2={yes, no}
SIGNAL3={yes, no}
SIGNAL4={yes, no}
+ Check equality of (Aq, Aq)=(A^{\dag}Aq, q) after every iteration (maybe time consuming)
TEST_OF_CONJUGATION={yes, no}
+ Output of short or full information at the file:
G_OUTPUT={short, full}
+ Write iterations log at the screen or save it into log file:
LOG_OUTPUT={stderr, TG_3D.log}

###Numerical parameters (configs/params.conf)
For setting numerical parameters the following keys can be used:
+ Required parameters:
  + --ky, **double**, *Wave-number in y direction*
  + --dz, **double**, *Step of discretization*
  + --C, **double**, *Constant for CFL condition*
+ Not required parameters:
  + --n, **double**, *Polytropic index*, default: 1.5
  + --kx, **double**, *Wave-number in x direction*, default: 0
  + --Topt, **double**, *Optimisation time*, default: 1
  + --Lz, **double**, *Half-thickness of the isothermal flow*, , default: 1
  + --q, **double**, *Shear rate*, default: 1.5
  + --mu, **double**, *Position of initial condition*, default: 0.2
  + --sigma, **double**, *Size of initial condition*, default: 0.1
  + --cores, **int**, *Number of openmp threads (0 --- all available)*, default: 0
  + --cond1, **double**, *First conditions of iterations interruption*, default -5
  + --cond2, **double**, *Second conditions of iterations interruption*, default -6
  + --cond4, **int**, *Fourth conditions of iterations interruption*, default 500

##Output format
The transient amplification factor is recorded in file "G_$BACKGROUND_$METRIC_$BOUNDARY" in the following format (one lines for one calculation, number in square brackets denote column number):
+ [1] Wave-number in x direction
+ [2] Wave-number in y direction
+ [3] Shear rate
+ [4] Polytropic index
+ [5] Step of discretization
+ [6] Constant for CFL condition
+ [7] Optimisation time
+ [8] Amplification factor
+ [9] First conditions of iterations interruption
+ [10] Condition that interrupted iterations during this calculations {1,2,3,4}.

By setting G_OUTPUT key to "full" additional information can be added to the output:
+ [11] F(kz=0, t=0)
+ [12] F(kz=0, t=Topt)
+ [13] kz_max(t=0)
+ [14] kz_max(t=Topt)
+ [15] F(kz_max(t=0), t=0)
+ [16] F(kz_max(t=Topt), t=Topt)
+ [17] Ex(t=0)
+ [18]    Ex(t=Topt)
+ [19] Ey(t=0)
+ [20] Ey(t=Topt)
+ [21] Ez(t=0)
+ [22] Ez(t=Topt)
+ [23] Ew(t=0)
+ [24] Ew(t=Topt)
+ [25] Number of curent singular value

Here F(kz, t) is a square of Fourier-amplitude of wave-number kz divided by sum of squares of all Fourier-amplitudes in the decomposition at time t,
kz_max(t) is wave-number corresponding to maximal F at time t,
E{x,y,z,w}(t) is energy component associated with {vx, vy, vz, w} in units of full energy of perturbation.

It is also possible to record perturbation profiles by using method "write" for classes "perturbation" and "optimal".
It records perturbation in folder "result", file name format "q=%.3lf kx=%.2lf ky=%.2lf t=%.2lf".
Format of output:
+ [1] coordinate
+ [2] v_x
+ [3] v_y
+ [4] v_z
+ [5] w
+ [6] energy density associated with v_x, v_y and v_z
+ [7] energy density associated with w

##Conditions of iterations interruption:
To determine moment to interruption of iterations it is naturally to use determination of singular vector:
A^{\dag} A q = \sigma^2 q.
That leads to the first condition:
||A^{\dag} A q -\sigma^2 q||^2 / sigma^2 ** 10^{cond1}

Unfortunately sometimes first condition cannot be met with fixed dz and C due to numerical errors of integration.
That's way it can be useful to use another criterions.
The second criterion interrupts iterations than changing of value X=||A^{\dag} A q -\sigma^2 q||^2 / sigma^2 become to slow:
(X_{i-1}-X{i})/X_{i-1}**10^{cond2}
The third one interrupts iterations when growth factor start decreasing.
And the fourth criterion interrupts iterations after cond4 iterations.
You can disable any of last three criterion in the link_keys.conf.
